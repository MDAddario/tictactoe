# Introduction
The tic tac toe game is an interactive game where a user can play tic tac toe on a board of any dimension against a computer, which will play perfectly.

# Word of caution
For dimensions 4 and up, immense computing power is required to craft the game tree necessary for the computer to play perfectly. It is only recommended to use the dimension=3 setting (use dimension=2 if boring).
